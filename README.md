## Overview

Goal Setter is a webapp made using MERN stack which lets you login as as user and list your goals for the day or a longer period of time !


## Tech Stack

The following technologies:

- React
- Redux Toolkit
- JWT
- Nodejs
- MongoDb
- Express.js
- Mongoose
- RESTful Api
- Axios
- Netlify
- Render

## Objectives

The idea is described in the following points:

- This is a webapp with 3 pages. We see the Login Page at first , the Register page and the Goals page.
- The users profile details and chat history are stored in a Mongodb Atlas Cluster
- I used React styled components to style the webapp
- I use React for the frontend and Nodejs , Expressjs for the backend and use Socket.io to relay information using websockets
- Created a RESTful API from scratch with Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose.
- Secure our API by adding JWT authentication
- Create our frontend and add authentication using Redux Toolkit to manage our global state.
- added the goals functionality and add goals to our Redux state
- Implement best practices and standards when structuring the files using nested elements, indentation, comments, and line breaks
- I used netlify to deploy and host the app as it is very convenient and free.
- I used Render to host the backend as a web service for free.
